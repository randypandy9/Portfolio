                        <h3> Womens Hybrid</h3>
                        <p><img src="bike_images/womens_hybrid.jpg" alt="some_text" width="357" height="208" ></p>
                        <p> The Ridgeback Velocity 2010 Womens Hybrid Bike comes complete with a 6061 Double butted Aluminium frame, cro moly Forks and shimano gearing. The Lithium One Womens hybrid is a fast and capable 700c flatbar bike with a nice upright riding position and built-in comfort thanks to the skinny tapered steel fork and Kenda Kwest 38c tyres. A more compact frame geometry with low slung top tube combined with shorter crank arm length, stem, narrower handlebars and female specific saddle makes the Lithium One Womens as comfortable for female riders as possible. A 6sp 14-34T freewheel combined with 28-38-48T Suntour chainset make for a great urban gear range. Perfect for city commuting duties or weekend jaunts along the canal towpath. Ergonomic bar-ends add comfort and power on ascents and offer an additional hand position.</p>
